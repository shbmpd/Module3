			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>
			Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients. Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

			Sushi
		</div>
		<p>
			The Japanese live long, and this is already a well known fact. One of the proven secrets of longevity is that they eat fish, a lot of them. ‚·‚µ, the highlight of their fish cuisine, became very popular all over the world and had been representing Japanese food ever since. There is even a word in English: Sushi. There are numerous types of sushi such as nigiri-sushi, maki-sushi, and sashimi.
             In the 7th century, Southeast Asians introduced the technique of pickling. After 500 years, the Japanese acquired this same practice which consisted of packing fish with rice. As the fish fermented, the rice produced a lactic acid which in turn caused the pickling of the pressed fish. This was the very first form of sushi, and it was called Nare-Sushi. Then in 15th and 16th century, an altered form, Nama-Nare, appeared due to lengthy process. After a century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo introduced the use of rice vinegar into the sushi rice to add a flavor of tartness. One of the best known kinds of sushi, nigiri, wasnft introduced until 1820fs by Hanaya Yohei of Edo. His morsels, which included fresh sliced raw fish combined with the vinegared rice, were prepared and served for customers directly from his portable sushi stall. It eventually won immediate demands over the nation and descended the sushi bars of today.
